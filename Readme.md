# Email Validator

A simple web application to validate email addresses. The application provides instant feedback on whether the entered email address is valid or not.

## Features

- Validates email format in real-time.
- Displays visual feedback using icons and color-coded borders.
- User-friendly interface with animation effects.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For real-time email validation logic.

## How It Works

1. User enters an email address in the input field.
2. The application checks the email format:
   - Ensures the presence of `@` and `.` in the correct positions.
   - Validates that the domain is at least three characters long after the last dot.
3. Feedback is provided:
   - A green checkmark for valid emails.
   - A red warning icon and error message for invalid emails.
4. The input field's border changes color to indicate the validation result.

## File Structure

- `EmailValidator.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `EmailValidator.css`: The CSS file for styling and animations.
- `EmailValidator.js`: The JavaScript file for email validation logic.

## How to Run

1. Download all the project files (`EmailValidator.html`, `EmailValidator.css`, and `EmailValidator.js`).
2. Open `EmailValidator.html` in a web browser.
3. Start typing an email address in the input field to see real-time validation.
